Dishwasher Upper Rack Adjuster Kit - White Wheels, Left and Right Sides



★★★★★
★★★★★
 597 Reviews


PartSelect Number PS10065979
Manufacturer Part Number W10712395
                    This authentic Dishwasher Upper Rack Adjuster Kit with white wheels is a kit made up of primarily plastic and metal components, which will require a screwdriver to install. This kit comes with all the necessary parts for a dishwasher rack adjuster.  It fits onto the dishwasher rack and connects it to the track allowing it to slide in and out. If broken then the rack will no longer slide properly, and the part must be replaced. In many cases, our customers have reported the top rack of their dishwasher hanging down or sagging due to the adjuster kit, particularly if the wheels, have broken or failed. If you are having problems in this area, this kit will help get your dishwasher back up and running. Check your model number and user manual to see if this part is right for you. The parts for this kit come as a package and are not generally sold individually.

Installation Instructions
Richard from OAKLAND, CA

Instruction from Whirlpool Not Good (No problem with Part Select)
Trial and error.  The instructions from Whirlpool included with the part had minuscule pictures so it was hard to follow.  The written instructions were good.  But "a picture is worth a thousand words."  Eventually it worked.  The metal replacement part is much better the the plastic original.  Not a good reflection on Whirlpool.

Dishwasher Rack Track Stop



★★★★★
★★★★★
 117 Reviews


PartSelect Number PS11746591
Manufacturer Part Number WP8565925
                    The rack track stop on your dishwasher is designed to stop the dish rack at the appropriate place when opening and closing the rack. If your dishwasher is not cleaning your dishes properly, the rack stop may need to be replaced. The replacement part may differ slightly from the broken part, depending on the model. However, the different styles are interchangeable. This product is sold individually and comes in both a white and grey plastic version. Many of our customers found this repair to be very easy and takes less than 30 minutes to complete. Simply snap the old part out and snap the new part into place. You will not require any tools to complete the job. This is an authentic part approved by the manufacturer.

Installation Instructions
Steven from WASHINGTON, DC

Upper rack wheels had begun to break off. Shoddy design and materials.
I carefully followed the video instructions step by step.  They were detailed, clear, and pointed out how to avoid installation mistakes. WIthout the video I would have been tempted to just figure it out myself - ("Hey, I'm a handy guy. How hard could it be, right?"). With the video I sailed right through with no dumb errors. The new rack adjuster wheel set is much sturdier than the Whirlpool original. It made sense to get new rack stops at the same time. Thank you, PartSelect.

Dishwasher Lower Dishrack Wheel

 328 Reviews


PartSelect Number PS3406971
Manufacturer Part Number W10195416
                    This OEM gray Dishwasher Lower Dishrack Wheel Assembly is a plastic kit that allows the rack to slide in and out of the dishwasher easily. If it breaks or becomes damaged. sliding will feel difficult. This can happen due to normal wear and tear, and the part should be replaced if this occurs. Check your model number and user manual to make sure this part is correct. It attaches directly to the dishrack. To repair, open the dishwasher door and pull out the lower dishrack. Next, push the tab from both sides and it should pop out. To install the new wheel assembly, place it on the rack and make sure the caps overlap the wire from the inside before you clip it in place by pushing the wheel. It measures roughly 3x6 inches.

Dishwasher Drive Belt



★★★★★
★★★★★
 168 Reviews


PartSelect Number PS16542496
Manufacturer Part Number WE03X29897
                    This Drive Belt is 89.5" long and comes in black, featuring four ribs on the inside for a better grip. This is a long belt that wraps all the way around the dryer drum, around a tension pulley, and then around the drive motor pulley, allowing all the parts to work together, spinning the drum as the motor rotates. If the drum will not turn when the dryer is turned on the belt is likely broken. It is common for belts to stretch or become brittle over time, which is what leads to the breakage. If broken, it should be replaced; the drum simply cannot spin without this belt. Refer to your model number and user manual to check if this part is right for you. Ensure you use work gloves to protect your hands from sharp internal parts during this repair. Please note: When comparing the length of your old belt to the length of the belt as stated here, remember that a small amount of stretching and contortion may occur with belts over time for a range of different reasons. Unless your belt is drastically different in length, this belt is what you are looking for despite any small inaccuracies. You will need to remove power to your appliance, remove the main panel, and access the motor drive to slip your new belt back into place.

Installation Instructions
Edwin from Seattle, WA

Dryer making grinding noises
We live in a Condominium, space is tight especially in the Utility room where the washer/dryer are located. Turned dryer breaker off at the electical panel. Removed the top cover and front assembly w/door and front drum support, right where the unit was located. Had to gain rear access  to loosen drum drive belt so undid the dryer vent hose to floor connection through a front acess hole. Moved the unit out to the breakfast nook as well as disconnecting the power cable from the wall socket. Removed the rear access panel covers and unhooked the drive belt. At the front  removed the top screws off the lower cross member to allow spreading of the side covers to allow the removal of the drum. Removed drum and found the bearing bushing gone, reduced to powder.Using the supplied instuction sheet, replaced the rear bearing assembly, replaced the drum after vacumming the whole interior and started the reassembly of the unit using the new belt and  moved the unit back into place. Reconnected the power cable and dryer vent then lastly replaced the lint filter and selector knob. Closed the breaker and turned on the machine, no noise!!!Incidently I am 78 years old. Thanks PartSelect.

PartSelect Number PS11756150
Manufacturer Part Number WPW10546503
                    This OEM Dishwasher Upper Rack Adjuster is a grayish-black, plastic part which will require a screwdriver to install.  It fits onto the dishwasher rack and connects it to the track allowing it to slide in and out. If broken then the rack will no longer slide properly, and the part must be replaced. The installation has been rated as "easy" by customers. Before beginning any repair, you should unplug the dishwasher and wear gloves to protect your hands. Check your model number and user manual to see if this part is right for you! Your dishwasher should have a left and right upper rack adjuster, and both are the same part. These parts are sold individually, so if you are looking to replace both, you will need to order two parts.

Broken parts on rack
Easy...easy....I first watched YouTube videos on how to fix our problem.    We replaced both tracks and also the rack adjuster on both sides of the rack.  The entire repair took about an hour and most of that time was spent finding the tools at our house!!  I ordered the parts on a Sunday evening and they were at our house on Tuesday!!!  Will use this sight again if repairs are needed.

Dishwasher Lower Spray Arm



★★★★★

 120 Reviews


PartSelect Number PS12585623
Manufacturer Part Number 5304517203
                    The Lower Spray Arm is used in your dishwasher to spray water and clean your dishes. If broken there will be visible damage or your dishes may no longer be cleaned properly. If your spray arm is broken (due to general wear or high heat), it should be replaced. Your lower spray arm will be located at the bottom of your dishwasher tub. Check your user manual and model number to ensure this model is right for you. This version is plastic and metal and comes in gray/blue. We recommend you wear work gloves to keep your hands safe when installing and disconnect power to the appliance. You will also want to make sure that you turn off the water supply to your dishwasher. From here, you will want to open the dishwasher, pull out the lower rack and set it aside. Remove the lower wash arm. On each side of the bottom of the spray arm, there are small locking tabs that can be pushed aside using a flathead screwdriver. Once released, the spray arm can easily be pulled off the dishwasher. Put the new lower wash arm in place and push it down to lock it in. Ensure it is spinning freely and does not hit the heating element. Return the lower dish rack into place and then close the dishwasher door.

Dishwasher Refrigerator Water Filter

PartSelect Number PS10063209
Manufacturer Part Number RPWFE
                    This NSF-certified water filter helps to improve the taste, quality, and health of your water by removing a number of contaminants including mercury, lead, and trace pharmaceuticals. The filter should be replaced every six month or after 300 gallons of water have been filtered. If you are unsure if your filter is due for replacement, another indicator is if the water flow from the dispenser has slowed down considerably. Replacing this part is a simple task that does not require any tools or shutting off the water or power supply to your fridge. Once the new filter has been installed, be sure to run at least two gallons of water through before consuming.

Dishwasher Lower Dishrack Wheel Assembly

PartSelect Number PS11750057
Manufacturer Part Number WPW10195417
                    This gray plastic lower dishrack roller is a part for your dishwasher. It attaches to the bottom of the lower dishrack, allowing it to move in and out smoothly. If the lower dishrack stops moving in and out easily or preventing you from being able to shut the dishwasher door, inspect the dishrack roller for damage. The assembly includes 2 rollers and the bracket that attaches to the dishrack (parts are not sold separately). This assembly is sold individually, so you will need 4 assemblies to replace them all in your appliance. For this easy repair, start by removing the lower dishrack from the appliance and set it on the counter. Use a screwdriver to pry off the old roller assembly from the lower tabs. Align the new part on the dishrack by snapping it in place.

Dishwasher Refrigerator Ice and Water Filter



★★★★★

 76 Reviews


PartSelect Number PS8746144
Manufacturer Part Number MWFP
                    This OEM ice and water filter fits side-by-side and bottom-freezer GE models. The most common reason you would need to change this part is if you have never updated your model and it is no longer filtering your water. This also may lead to your refrigerator not dispensing water or ice properly. Manufacturers recommend you change your filter every six months to ensure it properly filters impurities. Depending on the model, a red light might also indicate that the filter is due for a replacement. Note: As per the manufacturer, this is an updated water filter. If you have never installed the updated part or your old model was made by Culligan, you may need the adapter to install the filter. See related parts. This filter is located inside the refrigerators upper right corner. It is common for water to drip from the dispenser when being changed so place a cloth underneath before you begin this repair. To remove the filter, turn it to the left until it releases without pulling down. Fill the new filter with tap water to prepare it. Position the new filter into the holder taking note of the arrows. The arrow on the front should be facing out. Gently push up on the filter and turn it to the right to secure it. Do not over-tighten. To release air in the system run 1-1/2 gallons of water through it. If your model has a reset button, press and hold this for a few seconds to reset it.

Installation Instructions
Fred from River Ridge, LA

Ice Maker stopped dispensing ice through Ice Maker Dispensor.
After taking Ice Maker's ice collection container out, I noticed that the plastic cup drive was broken. I did a websearch for repair and replacement parts for our GE refrigerator. I found PartSelect website easy to navigate and find the replacement part necessary...and placed an order.Once I received the shipment, I placed the Cup Drive into position and used the flat edge of a knife to  allow the Cup Drive to slide into the tight-fitting position necessary. After positioning into place, I placed the ice collection bin back into the freezer...turned the ice-maker back on...and waited for ice to be made. A day later, the ice maker had produced enough ice to test the ice maker's dispensing mechinism. The cup drive worked perfectly...and ice began to be dispensed. The dispensor has been working ever since. I also replace the ice and water filter...another very easy task...of unscrewing the old and replacing with the new filter. After replacing the filter, I let the water dispensor run for 2 minutes to flush all air out the system. The water dispensor work perfectly.
