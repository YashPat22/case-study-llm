Refrigerator Ice and Water Filter
★★★★★
★★★★★
101 Reviews
PartSelect Number
PS11701542
Manufacturer Part Number
EDR1RXD1
This is an OEM replacement ice and water filter for your refrigerator. In side-by-side refrigerators, it is found in the top right corner or the bottom left grille. In bottom-freezer refrigerators, the filter is in the bottom left grille. In top-freezer units, the filter is located in the middle of the refrigerator. This NSF certified filter reduces 28 contaminants including pharmaceuticals, metals, minerals, pesticides, cysts, industrial chemicals, Class I Particulates and chlorine. It is made up of coconut carbon block and has three layers of filtration. The first layer is particle filtration that helps block larger contaminants. The second layer is micro-filtration, which prevents medium-sized impurities from passing. The third layer is called absorption filtration, which absorbs microscopic-sized pollutants. It measures 2 inches deep, 2 inches wide, 1-1/2 inches high, and weighs 0.5 lbs. To ensure your filter is working its best, it needs to be replaced every six months. This single filter has a simple, quick-turn installation feature that does not require any tools.

Manufacturer Part Number
242126602
This manufacturer-certified Refrigerator Door Shelf Bin, also known as a crisper bin or door shelf bin, is made of clear plastic, and is easy to install. It is used to hold items in the fridge, like jars, cans, and condiments and you'll be able to visually see if the part is broken or cracked. This particular shelf attaches to the fridge door. You can check if this model is right for your appliance by checking your user manual and model number. This part should simply snap into place without the need for any tools as part of the repair. Just carefully line up the slots on the door with the slots on the bin and slide the bin down to completely lock it into place. The part is sold individually, and fits many different types of side-by-side refrigerators.

Refrigerator Drive Belt
★★★★★
★★★★★
168 Reviews
PartSelect Number
PS16542496
Manufacturer Part Number
WE03X29897
This Drive Belt is 89.5" long and comes in black, featuring four ribs on the inside for a better grip. This is a long belt that wraps all the way around the dryer drum, around a tension pulley, and then around the drive motor pulley, allowing all the parts to work together, spinning the drum as the motor rotates. If the drum will not turn when the dryer is turned on the belt is likely broken. It is common for belts to stretch or become brittle over time, which is what leads to the breakage. If broken, it should be replaced; the drum simply cannot spin without this belt. Refer to your model number and user manual to check if this part is right for you. Ensure you use work gloves to protect your hands from sharp internal parts during this repair. Please note: When comparing the length of your old belt to the length of the belt as stated here, remember that a small amount of stretching and contortion may occur with belts over time for a range of different reasons. Unless your belt is drastically different in length, this belt is what you are looking for despite any small inaccuracies. You will need to remove power to your appliance, remove the main panel, and access the motor drive to slip your new belt back into place.

Installation Instructions
Edwin from Seattle, WA
Dryer making grinding noises
We live in a Condominium, space is tight especially in the Utility room where the washer/dryer are located. Turned dryer breaker off at the electical panel.
Removed the top cover and front assembly w/door and front drum support, right where the unit was located. Had to gain rear access  to loosen drum drive belt so undid the dryer vent hose to floor connection through a front acess hole. Moved the unit out to the breakfast nook as well as disconnecting the power cable from the wall socket. Removed the rear access panel covers and unhooked the drive belt. At the front  removed the top screws off the lower cross member to allow spreading of the side covers to allow the removal of the drum. Removed drum and found the bearing bushing gone, reduced to powder.
Using the supplied instuction sheet, replaced the rear bearing assembly, replaced the drum after vacumming the whole interior and started the reassembly of the unit using the new belt and  moved the unit back into place. Reconnected the power cable and dryer vent then lastly replaced the lint filter and selector knob. Closed the breaker and turned on the machine, no noise!!!
Incidently I am 78 years old. Thanks PartSelect.

Manufacturer Part Number
WE1M504
This authentic, white Drum Bearing Slide, also known as the bearing drum slide, glide, or pad, is a plastic, easy-to-install part for your dryer. It replaces the dryer's front drum slide to allow for easier movement.  You'll know if this part is an issue if your dryer is unable to tumble properly or is very noisy. Damage can come from regular use. The part attaches to the outermost side of the bearing. Check both slides for signs of wear, because they often wear at the same rate, and should be replaced at the same time; there are 2 of these particular slides per dryer. This part is sold individually, so you'll need to purchase multiple parts if replacing both at the same time.

Installation Instructions
Matthew from Plainfield, IL
Due to over loading of the dryer the drum ruined the slides and was making a bad noise due to plastic rubbing plastic
It was pretty easy.  After already taking apart the dryer to install a new belt I knew exactly my plan of action.  I removed the two screws that hold the top panel of the dryer to the front panel.  I then removed the top panel and removed the screws that hold the front to each side panel.  I than pulled the front away from the cabinet and drum.  I put the new slides in place and installed a new felt strip.  I put it back together and that was that.  Very easy.
